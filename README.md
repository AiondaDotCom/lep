# Law Enforcement Portal (LEP)

The LEP is a solution to establish an automated digital communication between police agencies and service providers (websites, internet and email service providers etc.).
In case of investigations of crimes there is a need to cooporate with police agencies which today is mostly done manually by human repetitive tasks.
With the LEP portal this human tasks should be mostly automated, so that there is an absolute minimum of human tasks.

There exist already a standard process and workflow how digitally police agencies in USA and Germany gets user information of huge internet service providers.
However there are currently no commercial and open source products to help small companies and private persons to establish an automated solution to handle police requests.

The goal is that this LEP portal becomes international standard how to handle police requests with service providers.
